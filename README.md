## ðŸŽ€ Rusty Chat 

Rusty Chat is a simple, TUI-based chat application built with Rust using the `cursive` crate for the user interface and `tokio` for asynchronous networking. It allows users to connect to a chat server and exchange messages in real-time.

### Project Structure
- `src/bin/server,rs`: The server-side implementation that handles incoming connections and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
- `src/bin/client.rs`: The client-side implementation that connects to the server, sends messages, and displays incoming messages in a TUI.


### Supported Platforms:
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (untested)

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Install using cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo install rusty-chat-app
    ```
3. Run the server:
    ```bash

4. In a new terminal, run the client:
