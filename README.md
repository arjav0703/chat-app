## ðŸŽ€ Rusty Chat 

Rusty Chat is a simple, TUI-based chat application built with Rust using the `cursive` crate for the user interface and `tokio` for asynchronous networking. It allows users to connect to a chat server and exchange messages in real-time.

### Project Structure
- `src/bin/server,rs`: The server-side implementation that handles incoming connections and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
- `src/bin/client.rs`: The client-side implementation that connects to the server, sends messages, and displays incoming messages in a TUI.


### Supported Platforms:
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (untested)

### Running the Application locally
1. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arjav0703/chat-app.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Start the server:

5. In a new terminal, start the client:

    ```
